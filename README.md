# GitHub Copilot Advanced Labs — The Agentic SDLC

A hands-on workshop that progressively builds **Agentic SDLC** skills. Across 8 labs (~1 hour each), participants go from using Copilot as a suggestion tool to orchestrating a fully autonomous development pipeline.

---

## The Progression

```
Lab 01-03:  Copilot as a TOOL         → you do the work, Copilot helps
Lab 04-05:  Copilot as a TEAM MEMBER  → you set standards, Copilot follows
Lab 06-07:  Copilot as a DEVELOPER    → you approve, Copilot does the work
Lab 08:     Copilot as a PIPELINE     → the loop runs itself
```

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Copilot** license (Individual, Business, or Enterprise)
- **VS Code** with the GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat extensions
- **Python 3.10+**
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) with the Copilot extension — `gh extension install github/gh-copilot`
- **[HVE Core](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core)** VS Code extension (Labs 04–08) — install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core)
- Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub

---

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/martaldsantos/ghcp-labs.git
cd ghcp-labs
```

Then navigate to the lab folder and follow its README:

```bash
cd lab01
```

## Course Structure

Each lab follows a consistent format:

1. **Scaffolded project** — realistic production code is provided
2. **Starter skeletons** — partially completed files with TODOs for participants
3. **Step-by-step instructions** — timed parts with clear objectives
4. **Hints** — expandable hints for when participants get stuck
5. **Solutions** — complete reference implementations in a `solutions/` folder
